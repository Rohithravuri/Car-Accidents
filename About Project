Road Accident Analysis Using Car Accidents Dataset
Objective: To identify distinct patterns of road accidents within the dataset and leverage these insights to formulate targeted safety measures.
Overview:
This project, conducted as part of my master’s program at Kent State University, delves into the analysis of a comprehensive dataset on car accidents. The primary goal was to uncover meaningful patterns and trends that could inform the development of targeted safety measures aimed at reducing road accidents.
Key Highlights:
	•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Applied data wrangling techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset was primed for analysis.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth EDA to identify significant patterns, such as accident hotspots, time-of-day trends, and weather-related accident frequency.
	•	Pattern Recognition: Leveraged statistical analysis and visualization techniques to extract key insights, including correlations between accident severity and external factors like road conditions and driver behavior.
	•	Recommendations: Based on the analysis, proposed actionable safety measures to address the identified risk factors, with a focus on preventing accidents during high-risk periods and conditions.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
This project not only enhanced my analytical skills but also provided valuable insights into road safety, contributing to my understanding of how data-driven approaches can be applied to real-world problems.
